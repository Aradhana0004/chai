            Getting tea everymornig on bed with recieving mothers tantrum of beeing sleepy head, has it's own beaty only some can taste. Sunday morning Chai Pe Charcha , of elders of my very big joint family, with us children playing hide and seek, while also listening what our elders are saying, was definately some fun, which I won't ever be able to forget,
            It has been fitted in my memory, in such a way that no one can be able to erase it,one of the most beautiful memory of my childhood.
           Remembering Days, where my father will ask my mother 3rd cup of tea and my Mom say's it been a hour only and you already asking for it, and then we kids of joint family also getting it with toast to dip and eat, the happiness of it can't be describe in words

               <b> Now it is enough of my Chai, lets have tour of my memory</b>
               <p>During winters in North India, covering ourselves in Blanket  watching horror movies was another level of fun.</p>
               <p>But what I most waited was to listen radio shows which broadcast at night, here are some glimpses of it</p>
